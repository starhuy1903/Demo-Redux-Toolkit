This project is demo how to use Redux-Toolkit, apply to Todo and Blog projects.

Some important concepts:
- How to set up store to react app using configureStore, createSlice
- How to create async action by using createAsyncThunk 
- Use createSelector to re-exported for ease of use
- Optimize performance
- Finally, using the RTK-Query to implement data fetching and caching, eliminating the need to hand-write logic yourself
